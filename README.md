  In the weeks from 15th January 2020  to 3rd June 2020,  headlines from 25 UK sources were analysed to classify their underlying sentiment as positive, negative or neutral in the reporting of Covid-19, it was discovered that 52% of them were classified as evoking negative emotional responses which can impact mental health and wellbeing (Aslam, Awan, Kashif, Parveen, & Syed, 2020). Searching the terms “sensationalised headlines impact” on Google Scholar returns a multitude of studies about the impact media representation of issues has on people’s perception of various topics from perceived shark risk to sex offenders (Google Scholar, 2021). Sentimentality can influence the virality of an article, with negatively and biased language generally being more popular, with headlines such as ”Nobel winner Gabriel Garcıa Marquez hospitalised in Mexico City” being more popular than “What’s next after the iGeneration” (Dimitrova, Markert, Otterbacher, & Piotrkowicz, 2017).

  Mental Health and general wellbeing have declined post covid, with further impacts expected such as increased anxiety, depression, anger and so on (Kathirve, 2020). The Reuters Institute Digital News Report (2021) states that trust in Australian newspapers has increased by 5%, and they were active in sharing health advice throughout covid, the report also found that mobile devices are now the most common way for people to access digital news media (Andi, et al., 2021). A study by Charagulla, Jayant and Kumar (2021) suggest mental health can be negatively or positively impacted by the news articles we are exposed to, and that the drive for ‘clicks’ by media outlets has skewed headline sentiment to be more negative. 
  This project proposes monitoring of digital news headlines presented to Australian audiences as an early detection system using Natural Language Processing in the form of topic modelling and sentiment analysis to identify current trends in order to assess potential impacts to general mental health and well being such as increased anxiety or the increased potential for anger or violence though exposure to digital media sources.

**Introduction**

This report outlines the WebCrawler and NLP Systems implemented to investigate headlines from five Australian Newspapers with both print and digital access, The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, Australian Financial Review, WA Today and the Brisbane Times and one online news source ABC news from a single day. Headlines and weblinks to articles were gathered from the main page of each website, with the description collected by visiting each individual article. This project has been limited to capturing only the headline and description of each article as common information offered to all readers accessing the news domain but could be expanded to include which articles were selected for reading, and alignment of the sentiment detected in the headline & description to the content of the article. 

The first NLP task implemented in this project is Topic Modelling, identifying the underlying topics and themes and is suited to textural data such as the headlines and descriptions of newspaper articles (Kumar & Vayansky, 2020). Sentiment analysis was the second NLP task implemented, which can be used to reveal behaviours and affective trends, as well as relational links such as mood and consumer confidence, or political opinion (Rose, Wen, & Yang, 2014). Sentiment analysis allows the detection of primary emotions through text and is a method of detecting polarity in a document within constraints such as multiple meanings for a single word or phrase, the size of the data set and rhetoric of the text (Hossain, Hossain, Karimuzzaman, & Rahman, 2021).
